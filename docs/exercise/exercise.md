## Project grading 

Description: invalid html. bigtitle and boxdescription are no valid html elements.
The application works fine.

Good commit log and nice testing (test for saving is commented out.).
Comments are good. Naming is good.

I award an extra point for nice work on CSS/JS.

Congratulations!
This is a very nice solution. 
The one thing that is missing is using the html validator at times.

Total grade: 5.9
